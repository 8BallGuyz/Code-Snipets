How It Works:

The OnCollisionEnter2D method detects collisions with objects tagged as "Enemy".
Lives are decremented by 1 on each collision.
If Lives reach zero, the GameOver() method is triggered. This method calls gameManager.Dead(), which should handle game-over logic such as displaying a game over screen.

Setup Steps:

Ensure Enemy GameObjects are tagged as "Enemy".
Set an appropriate starting value for Lives in the Inspector.
Attach a GameManager object to the gameManager variable in the Inspector.
Make sure the GameManager script has a Dead() method to handle game-over functionality.

🛠️ Optional Improvements:

Add animations for movement, sprinting, and game-over states.
Implement a cooldown or stamina system for sprinting.
Add sound effects for damage or sprint activation.
