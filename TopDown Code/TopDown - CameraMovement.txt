using UnityEngine;

public class camera_position : MonoBehaviour

    public Vector3 positioning = new Vector3(0f,0f,-10f);
    // Start is called once before the first execution of Update after the MonoBehaviour is created
    void Start()
    {
        
    }

    // Update is called once per frame
    void LateUpdate()

Step 1: Create the Script

In Unity, go to Assets > Create > C# Script and name it camera_position.
Open the script and paste the provided code.

Step 2: Attach the Script to the Camera

Select the Main Camera in the Hierarchy.
Drag and drop the camera_position script onto the Main Camera.

Step 3: Assign the Player Object

In the Inspector panel of the Main Camera, locate the Player field in the script.
Drag and drop your Player GameObject into the Player field.
Ensure the default offset (positioning) is set to (0, 0, -10) to keep the camera behind the player on the Z-axis.

Step 4: Test Your Setup

Press Play in Unity.
Move your player using your controls.
The camera will smoothly follow the player while maintaining the specified offset.

How It Works:

The script references the Player GameObject and adjusts the camera's position based on the player's position.
A Vector3 offset determines how far the camera stays from the player.
LateUpdate() ensures the camera updates after the player has moved, preventing laggy or jittery movement.

Optional Improvements:

Add smooth camera movement with interpolation using Vector3.Lerp for more fluid transitions.
Adjust the offset in the Inspector for better framing based on your gameâ€™s design.
